## About 
This repository stores my personal website hosted by GitHub Pages! 

This website will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I've been really putting off this project because it seemed too "easy" and "simple". However, this led me through a rabbit hole of learning 10 million different things at once... 

So this is my way of committing myself to focusing on taking things one step at a time. And also to make a nice personal website to showcase my learning!
